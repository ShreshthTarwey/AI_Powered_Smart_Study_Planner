# Smart Study Planner

Smart Study Planner is a full-stack web application designed to help students efficiently manage their study tasks, track progress, and stay motivated. Built using Flask for the backend and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, this app offers a clean, responsive interface with powerful features tailored for productivity and learning.

## Project Overview

- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login with personalized profiles including user interests.
- **Task & Calendar Management:** A dynamic calendar interface to add, view, edit, and delete study tasks with real-time status updates.
- **Gamification:** Engage users with a motivational XP system, streak tracking, levels, badges, and progress indicators.
- **Motivational Guidance:** Daily personalized motivational messages to inspire consistent study habits.
- **Tech Stack:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Jinja2 templates.

## Purpose

The project aims to empower students by organizing study schedules, gamifying progress to boost motivation, and integrating personalized encouragement for continuous learning.

Following sections break down the project folder and files, explaining their purpose and the logical flow of development to aid understanding and customization.

# Explanation of `config.py`

`
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

class Config:
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY", "dev-secret")
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///study_planner.db")
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
`


---

This configuration file contains the essential settings for your Flask application.

- `import os`  
  Imports the built-in Python module for interacting with the operating system, allowing access to environment variables.

- `from dotenv import load_dotenv`  
  Imports `load_dotenv` from the `python-dotenv` package, which loads environment variables from a `.env` file into your Python environment.

- `load_dotenv()`  
  Executes the loading of environment variables from a `.env` file, enabling you to configure settings like secret keys and database URLs without hardcoding them.

- `class Config:`  
  Defines the configuration class where all setup variables for the Flask app live.

- `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY", "dev-secret")`  
  Sets the secret key used by Flask for securely signing session cookies and other security-related needs. It attempts to retrieve `SECRET_KEY` from environment variables and falls back to `"dev-secret"` for development if not found. It is critical that in production a strong, unpredictable secret key is set via environment variables.

- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///study_planner.db")`  
  Configures the database connection string. It first tries to get a production database URL (e.g., PostgreSQL) from environment variables named `DATABASE_URL`. If unavailable, it defaults to a local SQLite database file named `study_planner.db`. This makes the app flexible for development and production environments without code changes.

- `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False`  
  Disables SQLAlchemyâ€™s event system that tracks modifications to objects and emits signals, which is unnecessary here and saves memory. Also suppresses runtime warnings about this feature.

---

**Summary:**  
This `config.py` file helps your Flask app keep sensitive credentials and environment-specific settings outside version control and your source code while providing default values for easy development. The class-based structure makes it easy to extend and manage configuration settings in large projects.

# Explanation of `__init__.py`

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_login import LoginManager

db = SQLAlchemy()
migrate = Migrate()
login_manager = LoginManager()
```

- Imports Flask core and key extensions.
- Creates instances of database (`db`), migration tool (`migrate`), and authentication manager (`login_manager`).
- These instances are unbound initially for flexible application creation.

```python
def create_app():
app = Flask(name, template_folder='templates', static_folder='static')
app.config.from_object('config.Config')
```

- Defines the application factory `create_app`.
- Creates new Flask app object specifying templates and static folder locations.
- Loads configuration from the `Config` class in `config.py`.


```python
db.init_app(app)
migrate.init_app(app, db)
login_manager.init_app(app)
login_manager.login_view = 'auth.login'
```


- Binds extensions to the app instance.
- Sets default login route to redirect unauthorized users.

```python
from .auth import auth_bp
from .main import main_bp
app.register_blueprint(auth_bp)
app.register_blueprint(main_bp)
```
`return app`

- Returns the fully configured Flask app instance ready to run.

---

This setup uses Flask's application factory pattern to modularize and initialize the app cleanly, allowing flexible app creation and easy extension integration.
